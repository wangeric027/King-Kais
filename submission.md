The project handout can be found [here](https://cs1230.graphics/projects/final/gear-up).

### Test Cases

Insert your test cases here. Be sure to include images/videos as needed!

### Design Choices

I fulfilled depth buffers, gbuffers, as well as deferred rendering. I designed multiple different
shaders to test each indicidual component of my featues. You can toggle between viewing the different
elements of my geometry buffer by passing in a different int. I create an fbo that holds
5 distinct textures: diffuse, specular, depth, normal, and poisition.
